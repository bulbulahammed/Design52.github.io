        Facebook Instant Articles is a tool designed for media publishers to
        distribute interactive content to their audience within the Facebook
        mobile app and via Facebook Messenger. Rooted in the same technology
        used by Facebook to load photos and videos, Instant Articles features
        the ability to load content up to ten times faster than standard mobile
        web articles. The fast and responsive design of Facebook Instant
        Articles has been favored by users, leading to 20% more instant articles
        read on average and a decrease in the likelihood of article abandonment
        by 70%. Facebook Instant Articles allows publishers to optimize their
        content, thus allow for a near immediate load time. Facebook Instant
        Articles features two types of ads in which Facebook advertisers will
        either choose to publish Instant Articles for new or existing campaigns,
        or publishers can include their own direct sold campaigns. Once Facebook
        advertisers have signed up for Instant Articles, they will be able to
        create Instant Article advertisements that will be available in carousel
        ad format, mobile app installs, link page posts and video ads. While
        Facebook Instant Articles does require much prep work, including having
        an RSS feed that displays all article content and a minimum of fifty
        articles to submit to Facebook for approval into the Facebook Instant
        Articles advertiser program, there is significant benefit for the
        advertiser, including better audience experiences, complete control of
        branding and the ability to integrate with measurement tools, including
        Google Analytics.
